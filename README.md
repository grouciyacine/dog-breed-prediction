# üê∂ Using Transfer Learning and tansorflow 2.0 to classify different dog breeds bold text

## 1.Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog. when i'm sitting at the cafe and i take a photo of a dog, want to know what breed of dog it is.

## 2.Data
In this project we're to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs. to do this we'll using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition it consists of a collection of 10,000 labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

## 3. Evaluation
the evaluation is a fille with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4.Features
some information about data :

we are dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.

There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).

there are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels)

there are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).
